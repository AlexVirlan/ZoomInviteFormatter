The templates & meetings from this folder are mainly as a backup if you mistakenly delete (or overwrite) the templates and/or meetings from your "Documents > ZIF templates & meetings" folder.

Please do not delete or overwrite the files within this folder.
Instead, you should copy them over to the "Documents > ZIF templates & meetings" folder if you need them.

Thank you!
